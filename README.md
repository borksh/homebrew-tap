# Bork Homebrew tap

This is somewhere to store Bork's formula code and add changes before submitting PRs to Homebrew core. The Bork formula is in Homebrew core at present, so there **should be no reason for you to actually use this tap**. It is publicly available for testing purposes only.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install borksh/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap borksh/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
